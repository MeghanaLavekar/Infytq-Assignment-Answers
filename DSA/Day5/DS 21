******************************************** LEVEL 3 ********** TIME TAKEN : 1 hours 19 mins **************************************************

The manager of an airport wants to generate various reports.

Details of the flights and passengers are stored as mentioned below:

    Flight details are stored as a list of strings. Suppose "AI890:BAN:MUM:1400" is a string in the flight details list, it should be interpreted as follows:
    AI890 is the flight name , BAN is the source, MUM is the destination and 1400 is the departure time (24 hour format).
    Passenger details are stored in a dictionary where key is the PNR number of the passenger and value is a list containing passenger details. Suppose "LW101":["Amanda","AI678","C7",25] is an element in the dictionary, it should be interpreted as follows:
    LW101 is the PNR number of the passenger and ["Amanda","AI678","C7",25] is the list in which the index 0, 1, 2 and 3 represents the passenger name, flight name, seat number and the baggage weight respectively.

Assume that we are considering only those flights which are departing between 0700hrs and 2000hrs.

Write a python program to perform the below mentioned functionalities.

find_flights(flight_time): This method accepts time in 24 hour format and returns the list of flights which are waiting to takeoff within another two hours starting from the given time (both inclusive).

sort_flight_list(flight_list): This method takes the flight details list as the input and returns the flight details list sorted based on the increasing order of their departure time.

get_passenger_details(flight_detail): This method takes a flight’s detail as input and returns the list of PNR numbers of the passengers who are waiting to board the given flight.

security_check(passenger_pnr_list): This method takes the list of PNR numbers of the passengers boarding a specific flight as the input and returns the list of PNR numbers of the passengers whose baggage has been cleared.
The baggage will be cleared if the baggage weight is between 0-25kg (both inclusive)

sort_passengers(passenger_pnr_list): This method takes the list of PNR numbers of the passengers whose baggage has been cleared as the input and returns the list of PNR numbers sorted based on the increasing order of their seat numbers. ( order of seats: A→J )

boarding(passenger_pnr_list): The passengers who have to board a flight should stand in a queue. This method takes the list of PNR numbers of the passengers sorted based on seat numbers as the input and returns the queue of PNR numbers of the passengers. The queue should be of the same size as that of the list. The first passenger in the list should be the first person to stand in the queue.

seating(passenger_queue):The flight has only one door which is at the back side. The passengers who board the flight are expected to occupy seats from the front. So the passenger who board last will be able to come out first from the flight. This method takes the queue of PNR numbers of the passengers as the input and returns the stack ( max size of the stack should be same as the size of the queue) which contains the PNR numbers of the passengers representing the seating.
